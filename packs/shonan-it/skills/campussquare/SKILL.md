# CampusSquare (Shonan Institute of Technology portal)

Reads the student's own records from CampusSquare (`https://portal.shonan-it.ac.jp/campusweb/`) in Tomo's visible
browser window: today's classes, registered courses, the school calendar, grades, credits and GPA, the graduation
self-check (自己判定) and the licence/programme self-check (資格自己判定). CampusSquare has no API, so this skill only
uses the `browser_*` tools. It is **read-only**: it never registers or cancels courses, never changes settings and
never types a password.

## When to Use

- "What classes do I have today / this term?", "Is there a cancelled class?", "Which room is my class in?"
- "How many times have I been absent in X?", "Am I at risk of failing a course for absences?"
- "How many credits do I still need?", "Can I graduate?", "Which category am I short in?",
  "Can I start graduation research (卒業研究) next year?"
- "Why does my grade say 未 / Y?", "Which courses did I fail and must take again?"
- "What is my GPA?", "What grade did I get in X?", "How much CAP is left?"
- Course recommendations that must respect the student's timetable, CAP and missing categories.
- "Can I still get the teaching licence / AI course certificate?"

Don't use for: course content or syllabus questions (use the syllabus search), school rules in general (term
guidance), or anything when the student said Tomo may not read grades (see `USER.md`: grades consent "never") —
then explain where the page is and let the student look.

## Rules

1. **The student signs in, never you.** You do not know and never type the password; Tomo has none. When a page shows
   the sign-in form (`ユーザー名` / `パスワード`, button `ログイン`), stop, tell the student to sign in in the browser
   window (user name = student number with an upper-case letter), and continue only after they say they are done.
2. **Only while the student watches.** Before opening a page, say which page you open and what you will read. Read
   grades, GPA and credit pages only in the conversation where the student asked for them.
3. **Read-only.** Allowed actions: open a page by URL, change the display filters (year, term, range), press
   `画面に表示する` or `判定` (they only compute and display). Never press `履修登録`/`取消`, the
   `指定された時間割の履修登録はこちらから` link, `設定保存`, calendar date cells (they add Myスケジュール entries),
   `ファイルに出力する` or `テキスト出力` (downloads).
4. **Minimal data; Tomo asks, not you.** CampusSquare is a personal-data site for Tomo: page snapshots there show only
   headings and controls, and every value you read with `browser_console` is shown to the student first, who decides
   whether it is sent to you. So extract only the columns the question needs (`references/extract.md`), in as few
   reads as possible, and never ask the student for permission yourself (no `clarify` for this). If a result says the
   student did not allow it, answer without it, say what you could not check, and do not ask again. If it says the
   student chose that Tomo may not read grades, explain where the page is and let them look. Name and student number
   arrive as `{{FULL_NAME}}` / `{{STUDENT_NUMBER}}`; never try to recover them.
5. **Sign out when done** with `browser_navigate` to `https://portal.shonan-it.ac.jp/campusweb/portal.do?page=logout`
   unless the student says they will keep using it. The page then shows `ログアウトしました。`

## Procedure

1. **Open the page directly.** Every menu item has a stable URL; open it with `browser_navigate` instead of clicking
   the menu (the side menu has hidden duplicate links). URLs and page layouts: `references/pages.md`.
   Done when the page title matches the page you wanted, or the sign-in form is shown (→ Rule 1, then reopen).
2. **Set filters only if needed.** Grades and credits pages start with a filter form: keep `過去を含めた全成績`
   for history, or choose `対象年度・学期の成績のみ` + year + term. Press `画面に表示する`. Self-check: pick the
   year (default is the student's year) and press `判定`.
   Done when the result tables are present.
3. **Extract with `browser_console`** using the expressions in `references/extract.md` (compact JSON, one row per
   course or category); prefer one extraction that returns everything the question needs. Snapshots only show controls here; use them to find a filter or button, never to read data.
   Done when you have the rows the question needs and the page's "as of" note (e.g. `※2026年度前学期終了時点の結果です。`).
4. **Answer with the source.** Name the page, term and "as of" date; quote numbers exactly as shown. For graduation
   questions, go through every category of the self-check (see Interpretation), not only the total.
   Done when every number in the answer comes from a page you read in this conversation.
5. **Sign out** (Rule 5).

## Interpretation

- **Lower years: judge the right thing.** 自己判定 judges the student's own year by default. For a 3rd year that is
  the **requirement for starting graduation research** (`□卒業研究履修要件単位`), not graduation. To answer "can I
  graduate", judge 4年 as well: for anyone not yet in 4th year it shows `留年` because the remaining courses are not
  taken yet. That is not a prediction: never tell the student they will be held back; say how many credits each
  category still needs and that the 4th-year result counts only what is earned or registered now.
- **Graduation needs every category, not just the total.** In 自己判定 each `■` row is a category with its own
  minimum (`基準単位数`); indented rows are its sub-requirements. A student fails graduation if any `■` category is
  short, even with ≥ 124 credits in total. Example: `■学科専門科目（必修・選必・選択）` needs 80. Report the
  categories marked `×` and how many credits each still needs (基準 − 修得 − 履修).
- `修得単位数` = earned; `履修単位数` = registered this term, not yet graded; `合格見込み` `〇` = met if the registered
  courses are passed, `×` = still short. `上限単位数` `-` = no upper limit; only credits up to the limit count.
- The self-check header shows `判定グループ` with the 専攻 (情報学部): use it to confirm the student's major.
- In the 4年 judgement the header `卒業要件単位数` is the credits counted so far and the `□卒業要件単位` row's 基準 is
  what is required (124); quote both.
- Grades (official: https://www.shonan-it.ac.jp/campuslife/syllabus/evaluation/): `評価` is the score (0–100) with
  `評語` S (90–100), A (80–89), B (70–79), C (60–69) = passed; `Ｄ` (59 or less) = failed. `評語` `未` = failed without a
  score: `評価` `X` = not enough work or no exam to grade, `Y` = **too many absences (5 or more)**, `Z` = other. `N` /
  `認` = recognised credit (passed, no score). Leave `N` rows out of score averages.
- Failed courses (`否`) give no credit; they must be registered again in a later term when the course is offered. A
  passed course cannot be taken again. A retaken course shows twice in 履修成績照会: use the newest row.
- GPA (official criteria): D, X, Y and Z count as 0 grade points and their credits stay in the denominator; for a
  retaken course only the newest result counts. A term GPA of 3.50 or more raises the next term's registration
  limit (CAP) by 4 credits, 3.00–3.49 by 2.
- `直前学期GPA`, `累積GPA`, `年度GPA`, `学期GPA` are the school's own numbers; never recompute GPA.
- `登録可能(CAP残り)`: credits that may still be registered this term; recommendations must fit in it. Credits outside
  graduation requirements are not counted there.
- **卒業研究Ａ/Ｂ** (4th year) is required, has no fixed day or period (`その他` / `他`) and often no attendance data.
  Ignore it when looking for free periods, clashes or recommendations; shorten its long instructor list in answers.
- `その他（不定期授業、集中授業、特別履修授業など）` courses take no timetable slot.
- Attendance (`出欠情報`) and cancellations (`休講補講`) are icons per course in 授業情報; `なし` in the icon text means
  no record. The course detail behind the `出欠情報` link has the per-class record: `○` present, `欠` absent, `他`
  late or another special case, empty = not held yet or not recorded. Courses without a fixed slot (4th-year ゼミ /
  卒業研究) usually have no record at all.
- **Five `欠` in a course = `Y`, failed — a school rule nobody can override**, not even the instructor
  (official: https://www.shonan-it.ac.jp/campuslife/syllabus/evaluation/, `Y：出席不足（欠席が5回以上）`). With 3 or
  4 `欠`, say it plainly: "one more absence (or two) and this course fails, and it cannot be fixed afterwards".
- **Lateness (`他`) is up to each instructor**: some count a few minutes late as present, some count one second as
  late, some turn e.g. 3 `他` into one `欠`. There is no school-wide rule. Report `他` separately from `欠`, never
  convert it yourself; when `他` could push a course towards five absences, tell the student to check that course's
  syllabus (成績評価 / 出席) or ask the instructor how lateness is counted.
- Classrooms are only in スケジュール管理 (`2限:科目名@1404講義室`); names there are shortened.

## Pitfalls

- The session ends after about 30 minutes without activity (`残り…分` in the header). If a page suddenly shows the
  sign-in form, follow Rule 1 and reopen the page; do not retry in a loop.
- URLs contain `_flowExecutionKey`, which expires; always start from the `_flowId` URL, never reuse an old key.
- Registration and cancellation only work in the registration period (`期限` shows `登録・取消期間外` otherwise).
  Even in the period, tell the student which `時間割コード` to enter and where; they press the buttons.
- The calendar (スケジュール管理) mixes school events with timetable slots; course slots only appear for courses with a
  fixed day and period.
- Page texts use full-width letters and digits (`Ｓ`, `１Ａ`); normalise before comparing with syllabus data.
- 資格自己判定 starts at 判定学年 4年 (unlike 自己判定) and its licence names include entry years (`（2024～）`); choose
  the right one before pressing `判定`.

## Verification

- The answer names the page and the "as of" note, and every number matches the page.
- No action other than those allowed in Rule 3 was taken (check the tool calls).
- The session was signed out, or the student said they continue.
