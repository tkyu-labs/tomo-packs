# Tomo packs

School packs for [Tomo](https://github.com/tkyu-labs/tomo), a desktop assistant for international students.
Tomo itself knows no school; a pack adds one school's knowledge, skills and first-run questionnaire (Hatch).

Packs are made by the community. They are not affiliated with, endorsed by or maintained by the schools they
describe. Tomo installs packs only from this repository: the `main` branch is the current version of every pack.

| Pack | School | Version |
|---|---|---|
| [`shonan-it`](packs/shonan-it) | Shonan Institute of Technology (湘南工科大学) | 0.1.0 (in development) |
| [`keio`](packs/keio) | Keio University (慶應義塾大学) | 0.1.0 |

## What a pack contains

```
packs/<id>/            id = the school's domain without the suffix, e.g. shonan-it for shonan-it.ac.jp
  pack.yaml            metadata, permissions, trusted sources, quick topics   (schema/pack.schema.json)
  hatch.yaml           first-run questionnaire and placeholders                (schema/hatch.schema.json)
  soul.md              what the assistant needs to know about the school
  skills/<name>/       Hermes skills (SKILL.md)
  mcp/<name>/          optional MCP servers (stdio)
  data/build.py        builds local indexes from public sources (output is not committed)
  evals/cases.yaml     regression questions
  pack.lock            file hashes (generated)
```

Rules that every pack follows:

- **Declarative first.** Permissions, sources, Hatch questions and placeholders are data; Tomo enforces them.
- **No engine plugins.** Code runs as skills or MCP servers, never inside the agent engine.
- **No personal data, no secrets, no large data files.** Identifiers are only placeholders such as
  `{{STUDENT_NUMBER}}`; indexes are built on the user's computer.
- **School systems through the browser only,** with the user's approval for every action.
- **Three languages.** Every user-facing text has English, Chinese and Japanese.

## Checking a pack

```
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
python tools/validate.py          # what CI runs on every pull request
python tools/validate.py --write  # update pack.lock files and catalog.json after changes
```

There are no pack releases: whatever is on `main` is what Tomo installs. Tomo notices a change through the pack's
`lock_sha256` in `catalog.json` and installs the files only when each one matches `pack.lock` — so always commit the
files `validate.py --write` produced.
